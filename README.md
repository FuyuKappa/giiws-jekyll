# Genshin Impact "Patches since last run for limited 5-star character" Infographics website
This site was made by me in order to facilitate creation of and storing of infographics which I make for hoyolab.

I previously made these using PowerPoint and it was slow, arduous, and prone to
formatting errors and inconsistencies.

The node.js server app can be found [here](https://github.com/FuyuKappa/giiws-nodejs/)

Still being built. Stay tuned.
